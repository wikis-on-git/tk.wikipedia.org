'''Muhammed ben Da'ud''' ([[1029]] &ndash; [[December 15]], [[1072]]), the second sultan of the dynasty of [[Seljuk Turks]], in [[Iran|Persia]], and great-grandson of [[Seljuk]], the founder of the dynasty. He assumed the name of Muhammed when he embraced [[Islam]], and on account of his military prowess he obtained the surname '''Alp Arslan''', which signifies "a valiant lion."  He is known to history as a valiant, generous, and heroic warrior and leader.

He succeeded his father [[Da'ud]] as ruler of [[Khorasan]] in [[1059]], and his uncle [[Toghrül|To&#x11F;rül]] as sultan of [[Iran]] and [[Baghdad]] in 1063, and thus became sole monarch of [[Iran|Persia]] from the river [[Oxus]] to the [[Tigris]]. In consolidating his empire and subduing contending factions he was ably assisted by [[Nizam ul-Mulk]], his [[vizier]], one of the most eminent statesmen in early [[Muslim]] history.  Peace and security being established in his dominions, he convoked an assembly of the states and declared his son [[Malik Shah I]] his heir and successor.  With the hope of acquiring immense booty in the rich church of St. Basil in [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]], the capital of [[Cappadocia]], he placed himself at the head of the Turkish cavalry, crossed the [[Euphrates]] and entered and plundered that city. He then marched into [[Armenia]] and [[History of Georgia|Georgia]], which (in [[1064]]) he finally subdued.  

In 1068 Alp Arslan invaded the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Byzantine Emperors|emperor]] [[Romanus IV]] Diogenes, assuming the command in person, met the invaders in [[Cilicia]]. In three arduous campaigns, the two first of which were conducted by the emperor himself while the third was directed by [[Manuel Comnenus]], the Turks were defeated in detail and finally (1070) driven across the Euphrates. In [[1071]] Romanus again took the field and advanced with 100,000 men, including a contingent of the Turkish tribe of the Uzes and of the French and Normans, under [[Ursel of Bahol]], into Armenia. At [[Manzikert]], on the Murad Tchai, north of [[Lake Van]], he was met by Alp Arslan; and the sultan having proposed terms of peace, which were scornfully rejected by the emperor, a battle took place &ndash; the [[Battle of Manzikert]] &ndash; in which the Greeks, after a terrible slaughter, were totally routed, a result due mainly to the rapid tactics of the Turkish cavalry. The largest army ever fielded by the Roman Empire was destroyed.  

Romanus, the Bzyantine (Eastern Roman) Emperor, was himself taken prisoner and conducted into the presence of Alp Arslan, who treated him with generosity, and terms of peace having been agreed to, dismissed him, loaded with presents and respectfully attended by a military guard.   This famous conversation is recorded to have taken place after Romanus IV was brought as a prisoner before the Sultan:

Alp Arslan: "What would you do if I was brought before you as a prisoner?"

Romanus: "Perhaps kill you, or exhibit you in the streets of Constantinople."

Alp Arslan: "My punishment is far heavier.  I forgive you, and set you free."

The Sultan was as good as his word, and freed the Emperor, loading him with presents.  Unfortunately, his subjects were far less kind than his enemy.

The terrible fate of the defeated emperor from his countrymen made the mercy of Alp Arlsan a curse.  Romanus was blinded and finally killed after great torment.  

After Alp Arslan's victories the balance in the near Asia changed completely in favour of [[Seljuk Turks]] and [[Sunnite|Sunni]] Muslims. While the Byzantine Empire was to continue for nearly another four centuries, and the Crusades would contest the issue for some time, their victory at Manzikert signalled the beginning of Turkish ascendancy in the Middle East.   Most historians, including Edward Gibbons, date the terrible defeat at Manzikert as the beginning of the end of the Eastern Roman Empire. Certainly the entry of Turkic farmers following their horsemen, ended the themes in Anatolia which had furnished the Empire with men and treasure. The importance of this battle, and the brilliance of Alp Arslan in fighting it, cannot be overstated. His greatness as a human being was reflected after the battle, in his treatment of prisoners.


The dominion of Alp Arslan now extended over much of western [[Asia]]. He soon prepared to march to the conquest of [[Turkestan]], the original seat of his ancestors. With a powerful army he advanced to the banks of the Oxus. Before he could pass the river with safety, however, it was necessary to subdue certain fortresses, one of which was for several days vigorously defended by the governor, [[Yussuf el-Harezmi]], a [[Khwarezmid Empire|Khwarezmian]].  He was, however, obliged to surrender and was carried a prisoner before the sultan, who condemned him to a cruel death.  Yussuf, in desperation, drew his dagger and rushed upon the sultan.  Alp Arslan, the most skilful archer of his day, motioned to his guards not to interfere and drew his bow, but his foot slipped, the arrow glanced aside and he received the assassin's dagger in his breast.  The wound proved mortal, and Alp Arslan expired a few hours after he received it.  As he lay dying, Alp Arsland whispered that his vanity had killed him.  "Alas," he is recorded to have said, "surrounded by great warriors devoted to my cause, guarded night and day by them, I should have allowed them to do their job.  I had been warned against trying to protect myself, and against letting my courage get in the way of my good sense.  I forgot those warnings, and here I lay, dying in agony.  Remember well the lessons learned, and do not allow your vanity to overreach your good sense..."

The message in this cannot be overstated either.  All the courage and brilliance in the world does not avail a person if fate is against him, or they allow their courage to overshadow their good sense.   Alp Arslan, a conquerer unequaled by anyone save Alexander or Ghenghis Khan, (and one who might have matched them had he lived!) died because he slipped after declining to allow his bodyguards to do their jobs. 

Alp Arslan died four days later from this wound on November 25, 1072 in his 42nd year, and was taken to [[Merv]] to be buried next to his father Ça&#287;r&#305; Bey. Upon his tomb lies the following inscription: 

“'''O those who saw the sky-high grandeur of Alp Arslan, behold!<br>
'''He is under the black soil now''''''...”
