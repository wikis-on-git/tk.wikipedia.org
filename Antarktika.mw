'''Antarctica''' ({{pron-en|ænˈtɑrktɪkə|en-us-Antarctica.ogg}}, is  [[Earth]]'s southernmost [[continent]], underlying the [[South Pole]]. It is situated in the [[Antarctic|Antarctic region]] of the [[southern hemisphere]], almost entirely south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], and is surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]. At 14.0 million&nbsp;km² (5.4 million&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), it is the fifth-largest continent in area after [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[North America]], and [[South America]]. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by [[ice]], which averages at least 1.6 kilometres (1.0&nbsp;mi) in thickness. 

Antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has the highest average [[elevation]] of all the continents.<ref>{{cite web | title=National Geophysical Data Center | publisher=National Satellite, Data, and Information Service| url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/2minrelief.html | dateformat=dmy |accessdate=9 June 2006}}</ref> Antarctica is considered a [[desert]], with annual precipitation of only 200&nbsp;mm (8 inches) along the coast and far less inland.<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted by C.

Only cold-adapted plants and animals survive there, including [[penguin]]s, [[Pinniped|seals]], many types of [[algae]], and [[Tundra]] vegetation.

Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' ("Southern Land") date back to antiquity, the first confirmed sighting of the continent is commonly accepted to have occurred in 1820 by the Russian expedition of [[Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev|Mikhail Lazarev]] and [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]]. The continent, however, remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of resources, and isolation. The first formal use of the name "Antarctica" as a continental name in the 1890s is attributed to the Scottish cartographer [[John George Bartholomew]]. The name ''Antarctica'' is the [[Romanization of Greek|romanized]] version of the [[Greek language|Greek]] compound word ''ανταρκτική'' (''antarktiké''), feminine of ''ανταρκτικός'' (''antarktikos''),<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%239514 Antarktikos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus</ref> meaning "opposite to the north".<ref>{{cite book|first=Bernadette |last=Hince |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lJd8_owUxFEC&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=antarctica+opposite+of+north+greek&source=web&ots=ACmVhnUkbo&sig=IbN0OK9FBy29RPzGdDqZevrlylk&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result |title=The Antarctic Dictionary |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |page=6 |isbn=9780957747111 |year=2000 |accessdate=2009-04-26}}</ref>  

The [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] was signed in 1959 by twelve countries; to date, forty-six countries have signed the treaty. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]]. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists of many nationalities and with different research interests.<ref name="cia">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ay.html#People|title=Antarctica - The World Factbook|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|date=2007-03-08|accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref>
==Taryhy==
Belief in the existence of a Terra Australis—a vast continent in the far south of the globe to "balance" the northern lands of Europe, Asia and North Africa—had existed since the times of Ptolemy (1st century AD), who suggested the idea to preserve the symmetry of all known landmasses in the world. Depictions of a large southern landmass were common in maps such as the early 16th century Turkish Piri Reis map. Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that South America and Australia were not part of the fabled "Antarctica", geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size.

European maps continued to show this hypothetical land until Captain James Cook's ships, HMS Resolution and Adventure, crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773, in December 1773 and again in January 1774.[6] Cook in fact came within about 75 miles (121 km) of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of field ice in January 1773.[7] The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica can be narrowed down to the crews of ships captained by three individuals. According to various organizations (the National Science Foundation,[8] NASA,[9] the University of California, San Diego,[10] and other sources),[11][12] ships captained by three men sighted Antarctica in 1820: Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen (a captain in the Russian Imperial Navy), Edward Bransfield (a captain in the Royal Navy), and Nathaniel Palmer (an American sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut). Von Bellingshausen saw Antarctica on 27 January 1820, three days before Bransfield sighted land, and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820. On that day the two-ship expedition led by Von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev reached a point within 32 kilometers (20 mi) of the Antarctic mainland and saw ice fields there. The first documented landing on mainland Antarctica was by the American sealer John Davis in West Antarctica on 7 February 1821, although some historians dispute this claim.


==Geografiyasy==
Antarctica is divided in two by the Transantarctic Mountains close to the neck between the Ross Sea and the Weddell Sea. The portion west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called West Antarctica and the remainder East Antarctica, because they roughly correspond to the Western and Eastern Hemispheres relative to the Greenwich meridian.

About 98% of Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, a sheet of ice averaging at least 1.6 km (1.0 mi) thick. The continent has about 90% of the world's ice (and thereby about 70% of the world's fresh water). If all of this ice were melted, sea levels would rise about 60 m (200 ft).[19] In most of the interior of the continent, precipitation is very low, down to 20 mm (0.8 in) per year; in a few "blue ice" areas precipitation is lower than mass loss by sublimation and so the local mass balance is negative. In the dry valleys the same effect occurs over a rock base, leading to a desiccated landscape.

West Antarctica is covered by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The sheet has been of recent concern because of the real, if small, possibility of its collapse. If the sheet were to break down, ocean levels would rise by several metres in a relatively geologically short period of time, perhaps a matter of centuries. Several Antarctic ice streams, which account for about 10% of the ice sheet, flow to one of the many Antarctic ice shelves.

===Flora===
The climate of Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor soil quality, lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit the flourishing of plants. As a result, plant life is limited to mostly mosses and liverworts. The autotrophic community is made up of mostly protists. The flora of the continent largely consists of lichens, bryophytes, algae, and fungi. Growth generally occurs in the summer, and only for a few weeks at most.

===Fauna===
Few terrestrial vertebrates live in Antarctica.[35] Invertebrate life includes microscopic mites like the Alaskozetes antarcticus , lice, nematodes, tardigrades, rotifers, krill and springtails. Recently ancient ecosystems consisting of several types of bacteria have been found living trapped deep beneath glaciers.[36] The flightless midge Belgica antarctica, just 12 millimeters (0.5 in) in size, is the largest purely terrestrial animal in Antarctica. The Snow Petrel is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in Antarctica. They have been seen at the South Pole.[citation needed]
