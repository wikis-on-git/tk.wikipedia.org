This battle took place on [[11 May]] [[1560]] near Jerba, [[Tunisia]], and was a victory for an Ottoman Turkish [[galley]] fleet under the command of [[Piyale]], over a mixed Christian galley fleet made up of Papal, [[Malta|Maltese]], [[Naples|Neapolitan]] etc. forces. The allies lost 27 galleys and some smaller vessels as well as the fortified island of Jerba. This victory marked perhaps the high point of Turkish power in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

'''Ships involved:'''

The naval '''Battle of Djerba''' took place in May [[1560]] near the island of [[Djerba]], [[Tunisia]] in which the [[Ottomans]] under [[Piyale Pasha]]'s command overwhelmed a large joint [[Europe]]an fleet, chiefly [[Spain|Spanish]] forces, sinking half its ships.<ref>[http://www.nmhschool.org/tthornton/mehistorydatabase/safavid_and_ottoman_eras.htm Ted Thornton's History of the Middle East Database]</ref>

==Background==
Since losing against [[Barbarossa (Ottoman admiral)|Barbarossa Hayreddin's]] [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] fleet at the [[Battle of Preveza]] in [[1538]] and the disastrous expedition of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] against Barbarossa in [[Algiers]] in [[1541]], the major European sea powers in the [[Mediterranean]], [[Spain]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], felt more and more threatened by the Ottomans and their corsair allies. Indeed, by [[1558]] [[Piyale Pasha]] had captured the [[Balearic Islands]] and together with [[Turgut Reis]] raided the Mediterranean coasts of Spain. King [[Philip II of Spain]] appealed to [[Pope Paul IV]] and his allies in Europe to organize an expedition to retake [[Tripoli]] from Turgut Reis, who had captured the city from the [[Knights Hospitaller|Maltese Knights]] in August [[1551]] and had subsequently been made [[Bey]] (Governor) of Tripoli by Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].

==Forces==
The historian [[William H. Prescott]] reportedly wrote that the sources describing the Djerba campaign were so contradictory that he defied the reader to reconcile them. Anyone attempting to piece together the campaign will be forced to the same conclusion. Most reputable historians believe that the fleet assembled by the allied Christian powers in [[1560]] consisted of between 50 and 60 galleys and between 40 and 60 smaller craft. For example, Giacomo Bosio, the official historian of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St John]] writes that there were 54 galleys.<ref> Giacomo Bosio, ''History of the Knights of St. John'', ed. by J. Baudoin, 1643, Book XV, p. 456. </ref> [[Fernand Braudel]]<ref>Braudel, Fernand. ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'' (University of California Press, Berkeley, 1995).{{pn}}</ref> also gives 54 warships plus 36 supply vessels. One of the most detailed accounts is by Carmel Testa<ref> Carmel Testa,''Romegas'' (Midsea Books, Malta, 2002).{{pn}}</ref> who evidently has access to the archives of the [[Knights of St. John]]. He lists precisely 54 galleys, 7 brigs, 17 frigates, 2 galleons, 28 merchant vessels and 12 small ships. These were supplied by a coalition that consisted of  [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Naples]], [[Sicily]], [[Florence]] the [[Papal States]], and the Knights of S. John.<ref>[http://www.dallog.com/savaslar/cerbe.htm Battle of Djerba] {{tr}}</ref><ref>R. C. Anderson, ''Naval Wars in the Levant 1559-1853'' (Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1952).{{pn}}</ref> The joint fleet was assembled at [[Messina]] under the command of Giovanni Andrea Doria, nephew of the Genoese admiral [[Andrea Doria]]. It first sailed to [[Malta]], where bad weather forced it to remain for two months. During this time some 2,000 men were lost to sickness.

On 10 February, 1560, the fleet set sail for Tripoli. The precise numbers of soldiers aboard are not known. Braudel gives 10,000-12,000; Testa 14,000; older figures in excess of 20,000 are clearly exaggerations considering the number of men a sixteenth-century galley could carry.

Although the expedition landed not far from Tripoli, the lack of water, sickness and a freak storm caused the commanders to abandon their original objective, and on 7 March they returned to the island of Djerba, which they quickly overran. The Viceroy of Sicily, Don Juan de la Cerda, Duke of Medina Coeli, ordered a fort to be built on the island, and construction was begun. By that time a Turkish fleet of about 86 galleys and galliots under the command of the Ottoman admiral [[Piyale Pasha]] was already underway from [[Istanbul]]. Piyale's fleet arrived at Djerba on 11 May 1560, much to the surprise of the Christian forces.<ref> John Guilmartin, ''Gunpowder and Galleys'' ([[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge, 1974).{{pn}}</ref>

==The battle==
The battle was over in a matter of hours, with about half the Christian galleys captured or sunk. Anderson<ref>Anderson op cit.{{pn}}</ref> gives the total number of Christian casualties as 18,000 but Guilmartin<ref>Guilmartin op cit.{{pn}}</ref> more conservatively puts the losses at about 9,000 of which about two-thirds would have been oarsmen.

The surviving soldiers took refuge in the fort they had completed just days earlier, which was soon attacked by the combined forces of Piyale Pasha and [[Turgut Reis]] (who had joined Piyale Pasha on the third day), but not before Giovanni Andrea Doria managed to escape in a small vessel. After a siege of three months, the garrison surrendered and, according to Bosio, Piyale carried about 5,000 prisoners back to Istanbul, including the Spanish commander, D. Alvaro de Sande, who had taken command of the Christian forces after Doria had fled. The accounts of the final days of the besieged garrison are irreconcilable. [[Ogier de Busbecq]], the Austrian [[Rulers of Austria|Habsburg]] ambassador to Constantinople, recounts in his famous ''Turkish Letters'' that, recognizing the futility of armed resistance, de Sande had tried to escape in a small boat, but was quickly captured.<ref>Oghier Ghiselin de Busbecq, ''Life and Letters'', volume I (Slatkine Reprints, Geneva, 1971).{{pn}}</ref> In other accounts, for instance Braudel's, he led a sortie on 29 July and was in that way captured. Through Busbecq's efforts, de Sande was ransomed and released several years later and fought against the Turks at the [[Siege of Malta]] in 1565.

==Aftermath==
The victory in the Battle of Djerba represented the apex of Ottoman naval domination in the Mediterranean, which had been growing since the victory at the [[Battle of Preveza]] 22 years earlier. The Ottomans soon assaulted the new base of the Knights of St John in [[Malta]] in 1565 (the Knights having  previously been expelled from [[Rhodes]] in 1522), but did not succeed this time. It was not until the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in [[1571]] that the myth of Turkish naval invincibility ended.
