'''Zonchio deňiz söweşi''' (şeýle-de '''Sapienza söweşi''') dört aýratyn günde bolup geçdi: Awgust 12, 20, 22 we 25, [[1499]]. Ol [[Osmanly–wenesiýa urşy (1499–1503)|1499-1503-nji ýyllardaky Osmanly–wenesiýa urşunyň]] bir bölegidir. ol gämileriň üstünde toplaryň ulanylan ilkinji deňiz söweşidir. 

In January [[1499]] [[Kemal Reis]] set sail from [[Istanbul]] with a force of 10 [[galley]]s and 4 other types of ships, and in July 1499 met with the huge Ottoman fleet which was sent to him by Davud Pasha and took over its command in order to wage a large scale war against the [[Republic of Venice]]. The Ottoman fleet consisted of 67 galleys, 20 [[galliot]]s and circa 200 smaller vessels.

After reaching [[Cape Zonchio]] in the [[Ionian Sea]] with the large Ottoman fleet in August 1499, [[Kemal Reis]] defeated the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] fleet of 47 galleys, 17 galliots and circa 100 smaller vessels under the command of [[Antonio Grimani]]. During the most critical stage of the battle, two Venetian carracks, captained by Andrea Loredan (a member of the influential Loredan family of Venice) and by Alban d'Armer, boarded one of the command ships of the Turkish fleet. The commander of the vessel, Burak Reis, was unable to disentangle his ship from the boarders and chose to set her aflame. The sight of the three great ships burning together dealt a severe blow to the Venetian morale.<ref>{{cite book|first=Sydney N.|last= Fisher|title=The Foreign Relation of Turkey, 1481-1512|page=Chapter 6|nopp=true}}.</ref>

Antonio Grimani was arrested on [[September 29]] but was eventually released. Grimani later became the [[Doge of Venice]] in 1521. The Ottoman Sultan [[Bayezid II]] gifted 10 of the captured Venetian galleys to Kemal Reis, who later stationed his fleet at the island of [[Cefalonia]] between October and December, 1499.

The Turks and Venetians soon confronted each other for a second time at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1500)|Second Battle of Lepanto]], which is also known as the Battle of Modon, and the Turks were once again victorious under Admiral [[Kemal Reis]].
